                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I am Danilo Malta, a self-starter IT student, currently working through a Full Stack Engineer course on the Codecademy platform. I have successfully completed HTML, CSS, and a portion of JavaScript modules so far, besides content related to several applications/platforms such as Git Bash, Git Hub, Visual Studio Code, and Node.js. On top of that, I have been practicing with some off-platform projects to gain more resources handling the tools. At this moment, I am fully dedicated to learning code, and I am looking for an opportunity to start in this industry. When I am not coding, I do love to play drumms, listen to some music, watch movies and sports, do some cooking, barbecue, have a drink and eat out, travel, go to the beach (in summertime), etc. I am a man of many hobbies.</p>
